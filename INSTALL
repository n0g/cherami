Install and configure saslauthd (you probably want to use "shadow" as authentication type)
make sure that /var/run/saslauthd belongs to group sasl
add user cherami and add it to group sasl

Configure your Options (like domain and port number) in the file config.h

Afterwards compile with "make all"

After starting "su cherami -c ./cherami" you can test the basic features of the mailserver
